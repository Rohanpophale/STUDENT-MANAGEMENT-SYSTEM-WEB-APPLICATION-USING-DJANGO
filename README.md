# STUDENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-WEB-APPLICATION-USING-DJANGO
DJANGO IS A HIGH-LEVEL PYTHON WEB FRAMEWORK THAT ENABLES RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF SECURE AND MAINTAINABLE WEBSITES.
AND BY USING IT I HAVE CREATED THIS STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHERE FIRST PART IS SIGN-IN, SIGN-UP PAGE AND CHANGE-PASSWORD PAGE AND THE SECOND PART IS CONSIST OF A MAIN DASHBOARD.
DASHBOARD IS CONSIST OF TWO LOGINS ONE IS ADMIN-LOGIN WHERE ADMIN CAN PERFORM ALL PUSH, POP AND VIEW OPERATIONS, AND ONOTHER IS USER-LOGIN IN WHICH ONLY PUSH OPERATION OF DATA CAN BE PERFORMED
